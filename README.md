setup.git
=========

This bash script can be run on a new linux environemnt (like an EC2 instance)
to configure both the machine and the individual development environment.
We have to install git first, clone this repository (use `git clone https://github.com/suhanree/setup.git` 
in the $HOME directory) to get the script, and then, run the setup script (`setup/setup.sh`).
