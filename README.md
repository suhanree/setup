setup.git
=========

This bash script can be run on a new linux environemnt (like an EC2 instance)
to configure both the machine and the individual development environment.
We have to install git first, clone this repository (use `git clone git@github.com:suhanree/setup.git` 
in the $HOME directory) to get files, and then, run the setup script (`setup/setup_cent.sh` or `setup_ubuntu.sh`, depending on linux distributions).
